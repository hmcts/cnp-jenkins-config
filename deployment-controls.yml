# Approved repositories allowlist.
# Only repositories listed here will be picked up by Jenkins org folder scans.
# The repository name must match the GitHub repo name exactly.
# Additional flags (e.g. deployment-enabled) are independent of the allowlist;
# presence in this list is sufficient for Jenkins inclusion.
